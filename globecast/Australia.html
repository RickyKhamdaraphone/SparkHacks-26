Crawford discussed the casting process with online publication Vulture, saying "The character description I initially got just said “A tall puppeteer.” That might’ve been it. I was like, Wait, I’m tall. This could work out for me. [Laughs.] Physically, I can relate to that" clarifying that she's "a full six feet".[6]</p>
